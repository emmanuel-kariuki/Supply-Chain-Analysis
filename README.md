# Supply-Chain-Analysis
This project provides an analysis of key operational and financial metrics within the supply chain. The goal was to identify drivers of profitability, quantify quality-related financial risks, and expose bottlenecks and inefficiencies within the logistics network.

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project was to leverage **SQL (MySQL)** and **Power BI** to transition raw supply chain data into actionable, business-oriented insights, specifically focused on:

1.  Identifying the core drivers of **profitability** and **sales volume**.
2.  Quantifying the **financial risk** associated with quality control and inspection backlogs.
3.  Exposing major **operational inefficiencies** in logistics and transportation.

## Dataset

The analysis is based on a single, consolidated CSV file:

| File Name | Description | Key Attributes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| ðŸ”— [Dataset](https://github.com/emmanuel-kariuki/Supply-Chain-Analysis/blob/main/cleaned_supply_chain_data.csv)  | A collection of 100 records detailing product, financial, logistics, quality, and supplier information per transaction. | `Profit`, `Revenue_generated`, `Defect_rates`, `Shipping_costs`, `Product_type`, `Transportation_modes`. |

-----

## Tools and Methodology

  * **Schema:** **Excel** (for initial data profiling and cleaning).
  * **Analysis:** **MySQL Workbench** (for EDA and analytical framework execution).
  * **Visualization:** **Power BI** (for creating a three-page, client-ready dashboard).

### Key Analytical Focus

The analysis was driven by specific business questions, resulting in the following critical insights:

| Focus Area | Key SQL/DAX Techniques Used | Key Finding |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Logistics** | `GROUP BY`, `AVG()` (Cost vs. Lead Time) | **Air Freight Anomaly:** Most expensive mode was the slowest mode. |
| **Quality Control**| `SUM(CASE WHEN...)`, `AVG()` (Defect Rates) | **Risk Backlog:** The highest profit was tied to **'Pending'** inspection results. |
| **Profitability**| `SUM()`, `AVG()` (Profit, Revenue) | **Divergent Strategy:** Skincare is the volume leader, while Cosmetics is the margin leader. |

## Key Project Insights and Actionable Recommendations

The analysis identified three high-impact areas for immediate stakeholder action:

### 1\. Critical Logistics Inefficiency (Air Freight Anomaly)

  * **Insight:** Air transport was found to be the most costly and yet had a paradoxically longer average lead time than Sea and Road transport. This is a severe failure in routing or carrier performance.
  * **Actionable Recommendation:** **Immediately suspend/reroute all non-essential Air shipments** and launch an audit with carriers to renegotiate Service Level Agreements (SLAs) based on documented performance failures.

### 2\. High Quality Risk Exposure

  * **Insight:** A large majority of total profit ($\approx 40\%$) was generated by products still under **'Pending'** inspection status, exposing the business to major recall/warranty risk.
  * **Actionable Recommendation:** **Enforce a strict 48-hour resolution time** for all quality inspections and resource the QC team to clear the existing backlog, assigning a definitive 'Pass' or 'Fail' status.

### 3\. Supplier and Product Segmentation

  * **Insight:** Specific supplier/location combinations exhibited higher average defect rates, requiring focused intervention. Profit drivers are split, with Skincare being the volume champion and Cosmetics the high-margin champion.
  * **Actionable Recommendation:** **Launch targeted quality audits** for high-defect suppliers. Optimize Skincare operations for cost efficiency, and prioritize the growth strategy for high-margin Cosmetics.

## How to Replicate Analysis

### 1\. SQL Setup (MySQL Workbench)

Use the following DDL to create the table structure before importing the CSV data:

```sql
CREATE TABLE supply_chain_data (
    Product_type VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    SKU VARCHAR(50) PRIMARY KEY,
    Price DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Number_of_products_sold INT,
    Revenue_generated DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Manufacturing_costs DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Costs DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Profit DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Availability INT,
    Stock_levels INT,
    Order_quantities INT,
    Production_volumes INT,
    Shipping_Lead_Time_days INT,
    Shipping_times INT,
    Shipping_carriers VARCHAR(50),
    Shipping_costs DECIMAL(10, 2),
    Transportation_modes VARCHAR(50),
    Routes VARCHAR(50),
    Lead_Time_Delta_days INT,
    Supplier_name VARCHAR(50),
    Location VARCHAR(50),
    Supplier_Lead_Time_days INT,
    Manufacturing_lead_time INT,
    Inspection_results VARCHAR(50),
    Defect_rates DECIMAL(5, 2),
    Customer_demographics VARCHAR(50)
);
```

### 2\. Key Analytical Query Example (Logistics Anomaly)

This query was crucial for identifying the Air freight problem:

```sql
SELECT
    Transportation_modes,
    ROUND(AVG(Shipping_costs), 2) AS Avg_Shipping_Cost,
    ROUND(AVG(Shipping_Lead_Time_days), 2) AS Avg_Lead_Time_Days,
    COUNT(*) AS Total_Shipments
FROM
    supply_chain_data
GROUP BY
    Transportation_modes
ORDER BY
    Avg_Shipping_Cost DESC;
```

### 3\. Power BI Dashboard

The dashboard is structured across three pages:

1.  **Financials:** Product Mix & Profitability
2.  **Quality:** Risk Quantification (Pending Status) & Supplier Hotspots
3.  **Logistics:** Cost vs. Speed Scatter Plot (High-Impact Visualization)
